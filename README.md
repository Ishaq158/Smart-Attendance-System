# Smart Attendance System using Face Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
The Smart Attendance System is a Java-based mini project developed to automate attendance marking using real-time face detection. The system captures live video from a camera, detects faces using OpenCV, and records attendance details such as date and time into a CSV file. This project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming concepts using Java along with basic computer vision techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To automate the attendance process using face detection
- To reduce manual effort and proxy attendance
- To apply OOPS concepts using Java in a real-time application
- To store attendance records in a simple and lightweight CSV dataset

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 17)
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifier
- CSV file (for dataset storage)

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
This project uses a CSV file as the dataset to store attendance information. Each time a face is detected by the camera, an entry is created in the CSV file containing the date and time. No trained facial data or registered student database is used in this project.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Install **Java JDK 17 or above**
2. Download and configure **OpenCV** for Java
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ishaq158/Smart-Attendance-System
Open the project in Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA

Add OpenCV library to the project build path

Run MainApp.java

📷 Output
Live camera feed

Real-time face detection

Automatic attendance entry in CSV file

⚠️ Limitations
Works best under good lighting conditions

Detection accuracy depends on camera quality

Performs face detection only (no face recognition or training)

🚀 Future Enhancements
Implement face recognition with trained datasets

Improve detection accuracy using deep learning

Add a graphical user interface (GUI)

Integrate database or cloud storage
